# Retail Edge

A modern retail management system built with Next.js, Clerk authentication, and a comprehensive POS system.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the client directory with the following variables:

```env
# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key_here

# Clerk URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/auth/login
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/auth/signup
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/pos
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/pos

# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Authentication Issues

If you're experiencing authentication issues:

1. Make sure all Clerk environment variables are properly set
2. Check the browser console for any authentication errors
3. Verify that your Clerk application is properly configured
4. Ensure the Clerk publishable key and secret key are correct
